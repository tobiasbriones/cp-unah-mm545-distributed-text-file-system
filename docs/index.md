## Original Course Instructions

I leave the [original course instructions](course) AS IS, so you can see that we
actually don't have professors in the university, and the level of
professionalism and technicism they have is under any basic standard.

My course projects usually don't have anything to do to what they do at class.

In these EPs/CPs I also \*use\* to worry more about developing concepts and
philosophies to understand underlying fundamentals, focusing into quality
instead of quantity. They will just check the superficials of assignments 
and don't care whether it's well done or wrong, or if students actually 
worked on the project as long as you show the project working superficially.

I just leaved my creativity flow to create this projects --homeworks on
steroids--, so I passed the classes and created something useful for me into
real life that gave me fun, knowledge, expertise for my portfolio, and much
more because I'm always transforming the bad into something good for me and
others intelligent enough to understand what I do and get benefited from it.

My standards are the most formalistic, so I doubt a random student will
benefit from my works, but someone --at least-- clever enough will, for sure.
