# Fix IntelliJ Gradle JVM

When I opened up the project after a long while, I had a problem to build
the modules.

After debugging the build output I found I was using another JDK version for
Java 8. Since I'm using the Gradle that has IntelliJ, I changed the Gradle JVM
version like so:

To find that error I had to use some options to print stacktrace or have 
more detailed verbose output messages and found the problem that the JDK 
version that appeared was not the right one.
