# Course Project at UNAH-MM545: Distributed Text File System

Implementation of a server/client application in Java RMI and JavaFX to manage concurrent connections for managing a file system that accepts operations on users text files.

## Required technologies

- Java RMI or Python Pyro only.
- Anything that works for the client.
- Linux containers.

## Getting started

This system can be deployed in several ways. According to the course topics,
you should use linux containers for the server applications. For this server,
there are two applications that run the distributed system:

- **RMI Registry:** Receives the request from clients to connect to the remote object
from the file server.
  

- **RMI File System Server:** Manages the actual file system and physical files in storage.
The clients access the remote object of this application through the RMI Registry, so
  the registry may be deployed separately from the server storing the actual
  files.
  
On the other side, for the client application you should run three or more of them
to show the real time functionality.

One way to deploy all the system is as a standalone fashion. This way you need tons
of RAM to run many VMs, JVMs, Linux Containers and other open applications as 
depicted by the following diagram:

In that case, I would even suggest trying to use GraalVM to avoid that crazy amount of
JVMs. That is something I haven't tested yet and the project at this stage is 
quite unstable. GraalVM also doesn't play well with the latest non-LTS Java versions and
just properly deploying JavaFX is a bit of a mess by itself these days mostly if you use the latest versions of tools prior waiting for issue fixes. So let's keep that game for later
with Java 17 LTS since I am also using `JDK 16` + `--enable-preview` as a good
mathematician to take advantage of
the new data oriented and FP features for the *model* (or domain) layer.
